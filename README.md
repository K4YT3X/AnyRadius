## Installation

### Clone the repository to download software

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/K4YT3X/AnyRadius.git
```

You can run AnyRadius directly, or you can choose to create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin/anyradius` or `/usr/local/bin/anyradius`. Creating a symbolic link enables you to launch AnyRadius directly in the command line without having to type python3 or specify the directory.

### Run AnyRadius directly through python command

```bash
$ python3 anyradius.py
```

### Create symbolic link and run AnyRadius

```bash
$ ln -s anyradius.py /usr/bin/anyradius  # Create symbolic link
$ anyradius  # Launch anyradius directly
```

## Usages

You can use any of the commands either by passing it directly into the software through command line arguments, or type it in the interactive shell.

### Interactive Shell

You can use either of the two commands to launch the interactive shell. It enables you to keep executing AnyRadius commands, **and it also supports tab completion**.

```bash
$ anyradius interactive
$ anyradius int
```
